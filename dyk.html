        <p>The Hindu gods were often associated with bees.
            The gods Vishnu, Krishnu, and Indra were called Madhava,
            the nectar-born ones, and their symbol is the bee.
            Vishnu is represented as a blue bee upon a lotus flower,
            the symbol of life, resurrection, and nature.
            The bee is blue because blue is the color of the sky from which the gods come.
            Where Vishnu steps, a spring of mead appears. Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu,
            is often depicted with a blue bee on his forehead. </p>

        <p>Bees played an essential role in Greek and Roman religious traditions.
            They, and the honey they produce, have many symbolic meanings.
            They also feature in many stories of the Greek and Roman gods.
            One story tells of the birth of Zeus, King of the Gods (renamed Jupiter by the Romans.)
            His father, the god Kronos, wished to destroy him, and so his mother smuggled
            him off to a secret cave on Mount Dicte. The cave was populated by sacred bees
            which fed the infant god honey. The god remained in the cave until he was grown,
            then dethroned his father Kronos and became the new king of the gods.
            Likely due to this story, one of Zeus’s titles was Melissaios, or “bee-man”.
            Zeus later rewarded the bees for their assistance by making them bright gold in color,
            and strong enough to resist cold and winds. </p>

        <p>It cannot be disputed that the Ancient Egyptians attached great religious and spiritual significance to the honey
            bee.
            Bees were associated with royalty in Egypt; indeed, as early as 3500 BC, the bee was the symbol of the King of Lower
            Egypt! (The symbol of the King of Upper Egypt was a reed). There are many examples of bee hieroglyphs to be found in
            the
            records, as well as hieroglyphs for honey and beekeeper. </p>
